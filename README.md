# SAR#  Drone Search & Rescue System  
### **AIU × JMU Capstone Collaboration (2025)**

##  Overview

This project is a collaborative capstone between **Al-Alamein International University (AIU)** and **James Madison University (JMU)**.

The goal is to develop an **autonomous UAV-based Search & Rescue (SAR) system** that uses:

- Aerial imagery from drones  
- AI-driven detection and tracking  
- Edge/GPU servers for real-time inference  
- A web dashboard for mission control  
- Simulation & testing using **AirSim**, **Isaac Sim**, and cloud compute
